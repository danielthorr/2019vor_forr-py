#   --------    Extra information   --------    #
#   bind() is used to associate the socket with a specific network interface and port number.
#   The values passed to bind() depend on the address family of the socket. In this example, socket.AF_INET expects a 2-tuple: (host, port).
#   host can be a hostname, IP address, or empty string. If an IP address is used, it should be IPv4.1 27.0.0.1 is the loopback interface, so only processes on the host will be able to connect to the server. If you pass an empty string, the server will accept connections on all available IPv4 interfaces.
#   port should be an integer from 1-65535 (0 is reserved). Itâ€™s the TCP port number to accept connections on from clients. Some systems may require superuser privileges if the port is < 1024.
