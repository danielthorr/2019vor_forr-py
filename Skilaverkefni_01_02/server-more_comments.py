# socket.socket creates a socket object that supports the context manager type so you can use it in a with statement
# AF_INET is the internet address family for IPv4
# SOCK_STREAM is the socket type for TCP, the protocol that will be used to transport our messages in the network

    # Bind to the port - read below for more thorough info on this.
    # Empty string means that the socket is going to accept any connection

    # starting in Python 3.5, it's optional to put in a value.
    # A default backlog value is chosen if empty
    serverSocket.listen()

    # accept() is a "blocking call" that holds an incoming connection
    # until system resources are ready then returns
    # a new socket object (type: tuple) representing the connection.

    # One thing that is imperative to understand is that accept makes a new socket object
    # so now we need to use THAT socket to communicate with the client.
    # It's NOT THE SAME SOCKET as we have been using up until now.

    # Use that socket object just like we used our original socket in a "with" statement

#   --------    Extra information   --------    #
#   bind() is used to associate the socket with a specific network interface and port number.
#   The values passed to bind() depend on the address family of the socket. In this example, socket.AF_INET expects a 2-tuple: (host, port).
#   host can be a hostname, IP address, or empty string. If an IP address is used, it should be IPv4.1 27.0.0.1 is the loopback interface, so only processes on the host will be able to connect to the server. If you pass an empty string, the server will accept connections on all available IPv4 interfaces.
#   port should be an integer from 1-65535 (0 is reserved). Itâ€™s the TCP port number to accept connections on from clients. Some systems may require superuser privileges if the port is < 1024.
